This HTML code defines a webpage featuring a vertical swiper with smooth scrolling functionality. The page includes a Swiper component, a popular JavaScript library for creating sliders, and utilizes smooth transitions between slides. Here's a description of the key components:

DOCTYPE and HTML Tags: Declares the HTML document type and sets the language to English.

Head Section: Contains meta tags for character set and viewport settings. It also includes a title for the webpage. External stylesheets for Swiper and additional internal styles are linked.

Body Section: Contains the main content of the webpage.

Swiper Container: A container for the vertical swiper, set to take up the full height of the viewport. It includes a wrapper for the individual slides.

Swiper Slides: Each slide represents a section of content. Initially, all slides have a low opacity, hiding them from view.

Services Overlay: Positioned to the left of the swiper, it includes a scrollbar and a list of services that can be clicked to navigate to specific slides.

Service Links: Clickable links corresponding to different services. Hovering over them changes the text color.

Scrollbar: A fixed vertical scrollbar with a scroll indicator that dynamically adjusts its height based on the number of services. Initially hidden, it becomes visible when interacting with the swiper.

Styles: Defines the styles for the entire page, swiper container, slides, services overlay, services, and the scrollbar.

Scripts: Includes the Swiper library and custom JavaScript. The script initializes the swiper, sets up event listeners for slide changes, and defines functions to update the active service and change the active slide when a service is clicked.

Overall, this code creates a visually appealing webpage with a vertical swiper and a synchronized services overlay for easy navigation between different sections or services.
